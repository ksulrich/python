rt_files/delete_failed_events.py                                         
and you can call it now in this way:                                     
                                                                         
a) wsadmin.bat -lang jython -f delete_failed_events.py                   
                                                                         
or                                                                       
                                                                         
b) wsadmin.bat -lang jython -f delete_failed_events.py 100               
                                                                         
                                                                         
a) is trying to delete all failed events and is resetting the failed     
events view in the admin console                                         
b) is deleting only 100 events and is not resetting the failed events    
view                                                                     
                                                                         
So, you can try to run a) several times and if you always get the error, 
try to run b) several times and if no more events gets deleted, run a)   
again.                                                                   
After all failed events are dropped (no more instances listed in the     
failed events view), you need to restart the Monitor model.
